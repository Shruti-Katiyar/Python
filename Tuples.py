#they are same as list but list are mutable but tuples are not they can not be changed once they are assigned
#tuples ans string are  immutable 
#tuples have ()

a=('a','b','c')
print(a)


#operations and functions are same as list
# len(tuple(a))
# max(tuple(a))
# min(tuple(a))
# # tuple(seq)
# # sum(tuple)
